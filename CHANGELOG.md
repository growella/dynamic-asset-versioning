## [0.2.0] - 2017-03-05

* Introduced this CHANGELOG.md file. Hopefully this will be the most meta entry in this file.
* Dynamic Asset Versioning now checks for [the `SCRIPT_DEBUG` constant](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress#SCRIPT_DEBUG) and, if set and true, file modification timestamps will not be applied ([#1]). Props to @petenelson for the suggestion!
